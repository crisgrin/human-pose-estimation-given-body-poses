In recent years the investigation of social relationships in order to get insights into behavior andmental as well as physical health has been growing. This project aims to explore two new approaches for the recognition of pairs of people to social relationships given the PISC data set. The first approach uses extracted skeleton key-points with ViTPose as a feature and feeds it to a NN. In comparison the second approach builds skeleton images with the previously extracted skeleton key-points and feeds it into the CNN ResNet-18. For this alterations were tested in resolution and color of the skeleton, so explore the trade-off of decreasing computational complexity and information loss. The evaluation indicated that while only using skeleton key-points as a feature does not perform sufficiently, skeleton images show promising results for social relationship recognition compared to other state-of-the-art approaches. However, further studies should re-evaluate the framework with cross-validation and the provided train-test split of the PISC data set.
